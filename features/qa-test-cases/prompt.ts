## Context
{{project_context}}

## PR code changes:
{{code_diff}}

## Documentation:
{{documentation}}
---
## Rules
- Read the diff to understand what changed
- Use the documentation to understand the intent and business rules behind those changes
- If no documentation is provided, infer intent from the diff alone and flag each assumption with "(assumed)"
- ONLY generate tests for rules that are NEW or CHANGED in this PR
- Assume everything untouched was already tested — do not include it
- If a rule was only rephrased with no behavior change, skip it
- Group related checks into one TC when possible
- Include at least one negative or edge-case TC per feature when the diff shows a guard, validation, or error path changed
- Test cases must follow this format: starting condition → action → expected result
- No jargon, no code, no technical details
- Skip permission checks unless permissions explicitly changed in this PR
---
## Output Format
You must return a JSON object with exactly these keys:
- "summary": (string) A concise one-sentence summary of what changed and why it matters to QA.
- "impactedFeatures": (array of objects) Each object must have:
    - "featureSlug": (string) The domain/feature-slug (e.g., "auth/login").
    - "testCases": (array of strings) Each string must be a test case in the "condition → action → expected result" format.
- "totalTests": (number) The total number of test cases across all features.

### Good TC examples:
- "Session has completed steps → AI scores step → Score AND confidence level (1–5) both appear"
- "Form has required field empty → User submits → Field is highlighted and submission is blocked"

### Bad TC examples:
- "Verify that the system handles the AI failure correctly" ← too vague
- "Call POST /api/score with missing body → Check 400 response" ← technical
- "User can still log in" ← untouched behavior`,
  overrides: {},
