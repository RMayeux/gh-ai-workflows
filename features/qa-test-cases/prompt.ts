## Context
{{project_context}}

## PR code changes:
{{code_diff}}

## Documentation:
{{documentation}}

## Previous QA comment (if any):
{{previous_comment}}

---
## Rules
- Read the diff to understand what changed
- Use the documentation to understand the intent and business rules behind those changes
- If no documentation is provided, infer intent from the diff alone and flag each assumption with "(assumed)"
- ONLY generate tests for rules that are NEW or CHANGED in this PR
- Assume everything untouched was already tested — do not include it
- If a rule was only rephrased with no behavior change, skip it
- Group related checks into one TC when possible
- Include at least one negative or edge-case TC per feature when the diff shows a guard, validation, or error path changed
- Test cases must follow this format: starting condition → action → expected result
- No jargon, no code, no technical details
- Skip permission checks unless permissions explicitly changed in this PR

## Rules when a previous comment exists
- Parse the previous comment to extract existing test cases
- A TC is "unchanged" if the behavior it covers has not changed in the new diff — copy it verbatim into unchangedTestCases
- A TC is "retired" if the behavior it covers no longer exists or was replaced — copy its text into retiredTestCases
- A TC is "new" or "updated" if it covers something new or changed — add it to impactedFeatures as usual
- Never rewrite or paraphrase unchanged or retired TCs — copy them character for character
- If no previous comment exists, return empty arrays for unchangedTestCases and retiredTestCases

## Output Format
You must return a JSON object that matches EXACTLY this structure — no extra keys, no renamed keys:

{
  "summary": "The scoring step now returns a confidence level alongside the score.",
  "impactedFeatures": [
    {
      "featureSlug": "scoring/confidence",
      "testCases": [
        "Session has completed steps → AI scores step → Score AND confidence level (1–5) both appear"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "unchangedTestCases": [
    "Form has required field empty → User submits → Field is highlighted and submission is blocked"
  ],
  "retiredTestCases": [
    "User submits form with score only → Score appears without confidence"
  ],
  "totalTests": 2
}

### Good TC examples:
- "Session has completed steps → AI scores step → Score AND confidence level (1–5) both appear"
- "Form has required field empty → User submits → Field is highlighted and submission is blocked"

### Bad TC examples:
- "Verify that the system handles the AI failure correctly" ← too vague
- "Call POST /api/score with missing body → Check 400 response" ← technical
- "User can still log in" ← untouched behavior`,
